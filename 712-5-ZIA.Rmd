### **1.**

*The following results all support the expert's theory. Raising the number of all three variables (GDP, doctors, and hospital beds) is likely to lower maternal mortality rates.*

```{r echo=F, include=F, results=F}
morttbl <- data.frame(
  Coefficients = c("GDP", "Doctors", "Hospital Beds"),
  Estimate = c("-0.06320", "-82.486", "-38.630"),
  "P-value" = c("1.16e-09", "4.11e=16", "1.23e-07"),
  RSquared = c(0.1902, 0.3756, 0.2633),
  FStatistic = c(41.34, 84.82, 32.88),
  "Residuals P value" = c("1.164e-09", "4.113e-16", "1.235e-07")
)

morttbl <- morttbl %>%
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic("striped", full_width=T, html_font="Cambria") %>%
  column_spec(1, border_right=T, bold=T)

<div class = "col-md-4">
#### **GDP**

**Size, Sign, and Significance:** For every +1% increase in GDP Per Capita, maternal mortality rates are predicted to decrease 0.6%, indicating a significant negative relationship between GDP and maternal mortality rates *(β = -0.006, p<0.001)*

**Model fit:** The model has a lower R squared, only explaining around 20% of the variation in maternal mortality rates *(R2 = 0.19, F(1,176)=41.3, p<0.05).*

```{r echo=F, include=T, message=F, warning=F, results=T}

  labs(x="GDP per Capita", y="Maternal Mortality") +
  theme_minimal()
```
</div>

<div class = "col-md-4">
#### **Doctors**

**Size, Sign, and Significance:** Findings suggests a significant negative relationship with maternal mortality rates. For every +1% increase in physicians per 1000 people, marital mortality rates are predicted to decrease 82% *(β = -82.49, p<0.001).*

**Model fit:** The model's R squared is also on the lower end, explaining for around 38% of the variation in maternal mortality rates *(R2 = 0.3756), F(1,141)=84.82 p<0.05)*

```{r echo=F, include=T, message=F, warning=F, results=T}

  theme_minimal()

```
</div>

<div class = "col-md-4">
#### **Hospital Beds**
**Size, Sign, and Significance:** For every +1% increase in hospital beds per 1000 people, marital mortality rates are predicted to decrease 38.6%. Like the previous two variables, this suggests a significant negative relationship between hospital beds and marital mortality *(β = -38.630, p<0.001)*

**Model fit:** The model explains around 26% of the variation in maternal mortality rates *(R2 = 0.2633), F(1,92)=32.88. p<0.05)*

### **2.**
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-4">
I predict that raising **health expenditure** (provisions for health services such as family planning, nutritional activities) might also lower maternal mortality rates.

```{r echo=F, include=F, results=F}

morthealth <- data.frame(
  Coefficients = c("Health Expenditure"),
  Estimate = c("-14.769"),
  "P-value" = c("0.0251"),
  RSquared = c(0.02817),
  FStatistic = c(5.102),
  "Residuals P value" = c(0.02512)
)

morthealth <- morthealth %>%
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic("striped", full_width=F, html_font="Cambria") %>%
  column_spec(1, border_right=T, bold=T) %>%
   scroll_box(width = "280px", height = "80px")

morthealth
```
</div>
<div class = "col-md-4">
**Size, Sign, and Significance:** An OLS regression also suggests that health expenditure has a significant negative relationship with maternal mortality rates. *(β = -14.77, p<0.05)*. For every +1% increase in health expenditure, maternal mortality rates are predicted to decrease about 15%. 

**Model fit:** This model's effect on variation in mortality rates is also much less than GDP, doctors, or hospital beds. Only 3% of the variation in maternal mortality rates can be explained by health expenditure *(R2 = 0.02817), F(1,176)=5.102, p<0.05).*

</div>
<div class = "col-md-4">
```{r echo=F, include=T, message=F, warning=F, results=T}
ggplot(WDI, aes(x=hexp, y=mort.mat)) +
  geom_point(color="palevioletred3") + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", linetype="dashed", se=F, color="palevioletred1") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,NA)) +
  labs(x="Health Expenditure (% of GDP)", y="Maternal Mortality") +
  theme_minimal()
```
</div>
</div>
Though results for health expenditure are less significant than the expert's variables, they are still significant nonetheless and suggest that an increase in health expenditure could lower maternal mortality rates.

farmlit <- lm(literacy ~ farmland, data=WDI)
summary(farmlit)
```

### **3.**
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-4">
I've chosen to explore a relationship between **farmland** and **literacy.** Movies have taught me that farms have people that don't have high levels of education. Of course that's not true, but I'd like to explore it anyway :)

```{r echo=F, include=F, results=F}
farmlit <- data.frame(
  Coefficients = c("Farmland"),
  Estimate = c("-0.3020"),
  "P-value" = c("0.226"),
  RSquared = c(0.03468),
  FStatistic = c(1.509),
  "Residuals P value" = c(0.2262)
)

farmlit <- farmlit %>%
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic("striped", full_width=T, html_font="Cambria") %>%
  column_spec(1, border_right=T, bold=T) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "280px", height = "80px")

farmlit
```
</div>

<div class = "col-md-4">
**Size, Sign, and Significance**: An OLS regression shows a negative
relationship between farmlands and literacy. The more "arable land" there is, the lower literacy rates are. However, these results are non-significant, having a p value of 0.226, indicating that there's a higher chance of these two variables having no relationship at all *(β = -0.3020, p>0.05)*.

**Model fit:** The model suggests that 3% of variation in literacy could be explained by percent of farmlands in a country. However, this is number is also non-significant *(R2 = 0.03468, F(1,42)=1.509, p>0.05). *

</div>

<div class = "col-md-4">
```{r echo=F, include=T, message=F, warning=F, results=T}
ggplot(WDI, aes(x=farmland, y=literacy)) +
  geom_point(color="coral3") + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", linetype="dashed", se=F, color="coral1") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,NA)) +
  labs(x="Farmland (% of Land Area)", y="Literacy Rate, %") +
  theme_minimal()

```
</div>
</div>

Given that the results are non-significant, suggesting that it's more likely that these variables have no relationship, I don't think this is a good model at all. In short, don't believe the movies.
